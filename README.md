### Hi there! :relaxed:
I am an embedded developer.

I'm practicing much more in the kernel space than in the user space. You can't make such a conclusion from my repository, but it is true.
I've been planning to post a lot of features for a long time but still can't find the time
for it. :eyes: Hope this will change soon.

I am open to ideas and suggestions.
