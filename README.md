Hi! I am 24 and I am an embedded developer.                     _                   _
I'm practicing much more in the kernel space than            JV@@@VL             JV@@@VL
in the user space. You can't make such a                   $^       ^$         $^       ^$
conclusion from my repository, but it is true.            $ _PP^      $ m^^^m $ _PP^      $
I am open to ideas and suggestions.                       $           $       $           $
                                                           $_       _$         $_       _$
                                                             IV@@@VP             IV@@@VP
                                                                ^                   ^

                                                          mm_        $$$$   $$$$        _mm
                                                         $M;       $$$$$$$V$$$$$$$       ;M$
                                                        ?$$$$mmm$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$mmm$$$$?
                                                         ?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$M^M$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$?
                                                           ?$$$$$$$$$$$V     V$$$$$$$$$$$?
                                                              ^^^^^^             ^^^^^^
